Features of the Dashboard- 

Risk Distribution Analysis:
          
    Heat maps, bar charts, and scatter plots showing how different factors (e.g., age, smoking status, cholesterol levels) contribute to heart attack likelihood.
Interactive Filters:
    
    Users can filter data by demographics (age, gender, region, etc.), lifestyle habits, and health metrics to drill down into specific groups or trends.
Comparative Visualizations:

    Compare high-risk and low-risk individuals based on lifestyle (e.g., screen time and sleep duration) and medical factors (e.g., cholesterol levels, BMI).
Insights Panel:

    Summarized findings, such as "Individuals with high stress levels and BMI over 30 have a 70% higher risk of heart attack compared to those with normal stress and BMI."
